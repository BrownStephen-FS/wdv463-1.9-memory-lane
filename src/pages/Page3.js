        One of my favorite technologies I have learned how to use during this
        degree is React. At first, React seemed to be very complicated and
        difficult to use. But with more practice I feel like this is the easiest
        way to build a website. I've always preferred JavaScript to all other
        languages, so using it to build a website is ideal to me. React also
        allows the developer to skip using CSS and use CSS in JS to style pages.
        I do find that I have to resort back to CSS when it comes to creating
        hover or action functionalities.
