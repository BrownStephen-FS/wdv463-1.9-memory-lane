        Two classes ago we learned how to use a technology called Twig. Overall,
        it was interesting on how everything worked, but I did find it
        confusing. Throughout the month I found myself constantly referring to
        the instructor's videos for help on fixing my issues. This is something
        I do not plan to use it in the future unless I have to for another
        class.
